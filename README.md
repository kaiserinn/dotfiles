# dotfiles

Some of my opinionated junkâ€”not really meant for anyone else to use, but you can do whatever you desire.

Use [yadm](https://github.com/yadm-dev/yadm) (and `git`) to quickly get it up and running.

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/kaiserinn/dotfiles.git
```

See [Getting Started](https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started).
